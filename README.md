🚀 Project Overview:

This project is part of my Python Development Internship (JUL25P1) at Pinnacle Labs.
I have developed a Unique Python Quiz Application using Tkinter, designed to:
Allow category-based quizzes (Python Basics, General Tech, Aptitude)
Present 10 multiple-choice questions per category with progress tracking
Enable answer review before final submission (view selected answers, correctness, and correct answers)
Display score and accuracy percentage at the end
This project strengthened my Python GUI skills, data handling, and clean event-driven programming practices.

✅ Features
